- Hey everyone! I’m @PeripheralSheep, a University Student studying Computer Science and Mathematics.
- I love learning about new concepts in Computer Science. My favourite part is figuring out how things work together and then building holistic designs based on it
- I’m currently learning Express.js for server-side and MySQL for database management.
- Eventually, I want to learn Python and Statistics to have a go at Machine Learning and Data Science
- Outside of Computer Science, I really enjoy learning Math as well, discovering the new concepts is fascinating although it may not always be real-world applicable
