- Hey everyone! Iâ€™m @PeripheralSheep, a University Student studying Computer Science and Mathematics.
- I love learning about new concepts in Computer Science. My favourite part is figuring out how things work together and then building holistic designs based on it
- Outside of Computer Science, I really enjoy learning Math as well, discovering the new concepts is fascinating although it may not always be real-world applicable
- I'm trying to get more exposure into building real world applications. So as time goes on, the projects here should look a little better ðŸ˜Š
